  (SBCMBON) tracks long-term patterns in species abundance and
  diversity. This dataset contains cover of kelp forest sessile
  invertebrates, understory macroalgae, and substrate types by
  integrating data from four contributing projects working in the kelp
  forests of the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. Divers collect data on
  using either uniform point contact (UPC) or random point contact (RPC)
  methods.

      
  The four contributing projects are two research projects: The Santa
  Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) and the Partnership for
  Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), the kelp forest
  monitoring program of the Santa Barbara Channel National Park, and the
  San Nicolas Island monitoring program supported by USGS. Together,
  these projects have recorded data for more than 200 species at
  approximately 100 sites on both the mainland coast and on the Santa
  Barbara Channel Islands. Sampling began in 1982 and is ongoing. Data
  were collected by human observation (divers using SCUBA) during
  regular surveys.

      
  Percent cover is recorded for taxa where individuals cannot be
  counted. Cover can be calculated from the data here as the fraction of
  total points at which the taxon was present x 100. With UPC and RPC
  methods, multiple species can be recorded at any given point. The
  total percent cover of all species combined using this method can
  exceed 100%; however, the percent cover of any single species cannot
  exceed 100%. See Methods for information on integration and data
  processing.

      
  MBON is funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  (NASA), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and National Oceanic
  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

  (SBCMBON) tracks long-term patterns in species abundance and
  diversity. This dataset contains cover of kelp forest sessile
  invertebrates, understory macroalgae, and substrate types by
  integrating data from four contributing projects working in the kelp
  forests of the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. Divers collect data on
  using either uniform point contact (UPC) or random point contact (RPC)
  methods.

      
  The four contributing projects are two research projects: The Santa
  Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) and the Partnership for
  Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), the kelp forest
  monitoring program of the Santa Barbara Channel National Park, and the
  San Nicolas Island monitoring program supported by USGS. Together,
  these projects have recorded data for more than 200 species at
  approximately 100 sites on both the mainland coast and on the Santa
  Barbara Channel Islands. Sampling began in 1982 and is ongoing. Data
  were collected by human observation (divers using SCUBA) during
  regular surveys.

      
  Percent cover is recorded for taxa where individuals cannot be
  counted. Cover can be calculated from the data here as the fraction of
  total points at which the taxon was present x 100. With UPC and RPC
  methods, multiple species can be recorded at any given point. The
  total percent cover of all species combined using this method can
  exceed 100%; however, the percent cover of any single species cannot
  exceed 100%. See Methods for information on integration and data
  processing.

      
  MBON is funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  (NASA), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and National Oceanic
  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
