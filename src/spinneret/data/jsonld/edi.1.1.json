Evaluating the interplay of these differently-scaled\n\t\t\t\tprocesses in the regulation of ecological systems is a challenging problem, but is crucial\n\t\t\t\ttowards understanding and predicting the potential effects of accelerated human activity on\n\t\t\t\tbiological diversity and ecosystem sustainability. Since 2000, two long-term field\n\t\t\t\texperiments have been underway in grasslands of eastern Kansas to investigate the interplay\n\t\t\t\tof soil resource availability, species interactions and regional processes governing plant\n\t\t\t\tsecondary succession, community assembly, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. Both\n\t\t\t\texperiments involve manipulations of soil nutrients in permanent grassland study plots and\n\t\t\t\temploy multi-species seed addition treatments to evaluate the contribution of dispersal\n\t\t\t\tlimitation and regional constraints on local species pools to the regulation of plant\n\t\t\t\tcommunity dynamics. \n       Old-field succession experiment, previously funded by the National Science Foundation,\n\t\t\t\twas initiated in 2001 in a section of the abandoned hay field that was sprayed with\n\t\t\t\therbicide, plowed and disked prior to the start of the study to investigate plant community\n\t\t\t\tdynamics in the context of old-field succession initiated on bare soil. The experimental\n\t\t\t\tdesign involves factorial experimental gradients of nitrogen (N) supply (four levels of N\n\t\t\t\tfertilization), phosphorus (P) supply (two levels of P fertilization) and plant propagule\n\t\t\t\tinput achieved by adding seeds of 50+ native and naturalized species to half of the study\n\t\t\t\tplots. With annual sampling this experiment allows us to examine old-field succession and\n\t\t\t\tcommunity assembly unfolding along gradients of N and P fertilization and under conditions\n\t\t\t\tof ambient and experimentally-enriched species pools.", "url": "https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=1&revision=1", "version": "1", "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["LTREB", "NSF", "plant community", "succession", "fertilization"], "identifier": "edi.1.1", "citation": "Foster, B.
